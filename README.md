# Our Wedding Infrastructure

Because every Wedding RSVP website needs to be provisioned using Terraform (Cloud) within AWS.

## Overview

Foundational infrastructure for the Wedding _service_ is provisioned using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud), and can be found within this repository.
Transient infrastructure such as Lambda functions/API-gateways (which change based on each deployment) are handled using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/); with the application itself being responsible for these concerns.
Resources created at this level (within Terraform) can expose details to the transient application infrastructure by way of [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) secrets and [SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) parameters.

Below is a table detailing how each concern has been broken up into logical separated units.

| Context | Name                                       | Purpose                            | Example resources                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Shared  | [Network](./shared/network)                | Communication, spanning all stages | Route53 hosted zones for root domain     |
| Stage   | [Apps/`Application`](./stage/apps/website) | Fulfil runtime requirements        | CloudFront, SSM, SQS, SNS                |
| Stage   | [Data/`Application`](./stage/data/website) | Permanent storage                  | RDS, S3 (User uploads)                   |
| Stage   | Health                                     | Monitoring and alerting            | S3 (logs), CloudTrail, CloudWatch alarms |
| Stage   | [Network](./stage/network)                 | Communication, within given stage  | VPC, VPC endpoints, DNS, NAT-instance    |
| Stage   | [Security](./stage/security)               | Security                           | KMS, WAF, GuardDuty                      |

### Project Contexts

Terraform projects which compose the the Wedding _service_ have been broken up into two seperate contexts - _Shared_ and _Stage_.

**Stage**

_Stage_ projects are for infrastructural concerns which relate to a given stage environment, for example `staging` and `prod`.
There is expected to be an instance of each given project _per_ stage environment.
Resources within a project can be shared throughout the same environment, but _not_ cross into different stage environments.
Within Terraform Cloud we suffix the given project with the stage name to identify its' environment.

**Shared**

_Shared_ projects are for cross-cutting concerns which span all stages - and are shared throughout the _service_ as a whole.

Resources within this _service_ have been designed in such a way that they can placed within the same AWS account, or multiple seperate AWS accounts.

### Stage Applications

The _service_ is composed of many _applications_ which are logically seperated within a given _stage_ based on runtime/storage requirements.
Currently there is only a single _application_ named **Website**, which manages the infrastructure for the [RSVP website](https://github.com/eddmann/our-wedding-website).
However, within the Wedding _service_ you could possibly see other applications such as a wedding-day photo upload service being added (although, unsure if I will actually have time to do this üò¨).

## Tooling

There is a [Makefile](./Makefile) to provide tooling to assist continued development of the _service_.
So as to ensure coding standards are met and any security issues caught before provisionment, the following tools are relied upon:

- [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) - Fixes possible errors and enforces best-practises.
- [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) - Static analysis tool to spot potential security issues.
- [tfdoc](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs) - generates structured documentation for each Terraform project.

These tools are run (via `make can-release`) within a [GitHub workflow](./.github/workflows/test.yml) upon each push to the repository.
They can also be run locally by invoking the same Make target.
